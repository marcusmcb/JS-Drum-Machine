# JSP-1 | Javascript Sample Player

This is a simple sample player/drum machine app built with Javascript. It was developed using the base concept from one of the JavaScript30 tutorials on YouTube.  Differences from the original code include HTML/CSS changes (to customize the look of the app) as well additional JavaScript functionality for the user to change sound kits.

### Link to the app:

### Using the drum machine:

Simply press the letters on your keyboard to trigger the corresponding sounds.

Use the kit buttons below the "keyboard" to swap kits that will change the playable drum sounds.

Enjoy!
