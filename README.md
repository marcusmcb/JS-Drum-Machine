# JS-Drum-Machine

This is a simple drum machine app built with Javascript. It was developed using one of the tutorials from the Javascript 30 series on YouTube.  I tweaked the code a bit to customize the look of the app.

### Link to the app:

### Using the drum machine:

Simply press the letters on your keyboard to trigger the corresponding sounds.

Functionality to the drum kit selector buttons currently in development, FYI.

Enjoy!
