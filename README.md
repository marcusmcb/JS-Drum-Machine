# JS-Drum-Machine

This is a simple drum machine app built with Javascript. It was developed using one of the tutorials from the Javascript 30 series on YouTube.  I tweaked the code a bit to customize the look of the app.

### Link to the app:

### Using the drum machine:

Simply press the letters on your keyboard to trigger the corresponding sounds.

Use the kit buttons below the "keyboard" to swap kits that will change the playable drum sounds.

Enjoy!
