# JSP-1 | Javascript Sample Player

This is a sample player/drum machine app built with Javascript. It was developed using the base concept from one of the JavaScript30 tutorials on YouTube.

Differences from the original code include:

* NHTML/CSS changes (to customize the look and layout of the app)
* MIDI input with selected devices
* additional JavaScript functionality for the user to change sound kits

### Link to the app:

### Using the sampler (QWERTY):

Simply press the letters on your keyboard to trigger the corresponding sounds.

Use the kit buttons below the key row to swap kits that will change the playable drum sounds.

### Using the sampler (MIDI):

Connect your MIDI device to your laptop/desktop and then refresh the app in your browser.

Supported devices (verified working in Chrome):

* Novation Launchkey Mini MK3 - use the first nine white keys starting from the left to play sounds (using the default octave setting)
* Native Instruments M32 - use the first nine white keys starting from the left to play sounds (using the default MIDI mode on boot up)
* Arturia BeatStep - use the front pad row to play sounds (no other set up needed!)


Enjoy!
